# connect-four-network
# A small project made with a classmate in our first year Java class to demonstrate
# the combined use of JavaFX, threading, and sockets

# Connect Four which plays in a server/client model over an internal network
# and incorporates a basic chat window

# Notes on use:
# Server must be open for connections first (enter the name and hit start) before client
