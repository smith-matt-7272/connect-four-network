# connect-four-network
A small project made with a classmate in our first year Java class to demonstrate
the combined use of JavaFX, threading, and sockets

Connect Four which plays in a server/client model over an internal network
and incorporates a basic chat window

# To-do List
There is lots of duplication between Client and Server that could definitely
be cleaned up.\
Once cleanup and documentation done, created server and client as runnable jar files.

# Notes on use:
Server must be open for connections first (enter the name and hit start) before client
